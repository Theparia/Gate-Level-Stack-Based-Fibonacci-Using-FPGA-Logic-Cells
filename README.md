# Gate-Level-Stack-Based-Fibonacci-Implementation-Using-FPGA-Logic-Cells

The goal of this project is to implement a fibonacci function using a stack. The C implementation of this function is as follows:
 ```C
int fib(int n){
  if(n <= 1) 
    return 1;
  return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
}
 ```
 In this project, we are allowed to design nad implement gate-level datapath and controller using Actel programmable logic cells which are shown below:
